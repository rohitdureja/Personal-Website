### About Me

{: style="text-align: center;"} 

I work as an R&D engineer in the [formal verification tools team](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/Formal_Methods-Home/index.shtml) within IBM. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Iowa State University working in the [Laboratory for Temporal Logic](http://laboratory.temporallogic.org/), and advised by [Kristin Y. Rozier](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/kyrozier/) and [Gianfranco Ciardo](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~ciardo/). I obtained my M.S. in Embedded Systems from the University of Pennsylvania, and B.E. from the University of Delhi.
