About Me
--------
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am a second year PhD student at Iowa State University working in the [Laboratory for Temporal Logic](http://laboratory.temporallogic.org/), and advised by [Kristin Y. Rozier](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/kyrozier/). I obtained my M.S. in Embedded Systems from the University of Pennsylvania, and B.E. from the University of Delhi.

My current research interests are in algorithms, and tools and techniques for formal analysis and construction of systems. Specifically, I am interested in model checking, compositional and parametric modeling, and applications of formal methods. Earlier, I did some research in the design of embedded systems for applications in brain machine interfaces.
