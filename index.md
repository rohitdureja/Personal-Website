About Me
--------
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I am a PhD student at Iowa State University working in the [Laboratory for Temporal Logic](http://laboratory.temporallogic.org/), and advised by [Kristin Y. Rozier](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/kyrozier/) and [Gianfranco Ciardo](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~ciardo/). My research focuses on the use of formal methods to scale symbolic model checking algorithms. Specifically, I am interested in the design of tools and algorithms that check sets of models. More recently, I have been interested in <i>model-set relevance</i>, i.e., to prove a property about a set of system models, how do you decide which part of the models are relevant to that property? Earlier, I did some research in the design of embedded systems for applications in brain machine interfaces. I obtained my M.S. in Embedded Systems from the University of Pennsylvania, and B.E. from the University of Delhi.
