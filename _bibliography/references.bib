abstract  = {From equivalence checking to functional verification to design-space exploration, industrial verification tasks entail checking a large number of properties on the same design. State-of-the-art tools typically solve all properties concurrently, or one-at-a-time. They do not optimally exploit subproblem sharing between properties, leaving an opportunity to save considerable verification resource via concurrent verification of properties with nearly identical cone of influence (COI). These high-affinity properties can be concurrently solved; the verification effort expended for one can be directly reused to accelerate the verification of the others, without hurting per-property verification resources through bloating COI size. We present a near-linear runtime algorithm for partitioning properties into provably high-affinity groups for concurrent solution. We also present an effective method to partition high-structural-affinity groups using semantic feedback, to yield an optimal multi-property localization abstraction solution. Experiments demonstrate substantial end-to-end verification speedups through these techniques, leveraging parallel solution of individual groups},

abstract  = {SAT-based techniques comprise the state-of-the-art in functional verification of safety-critical hardware and software, including IC3/PDR-based model checking and Bounded Model Checking (BMC). BMC is the incontrovertible best method for unsafety checking, aka bug-finding. Complementary Approximate Reachability (CAR) and IC3/PDR complement BMC for bug-finding by detecting different sets of bugs. To boost the efficiency of formal verification, we introduce heuristics involving intersection and rotation of the assumption literals used in the SAT encodings of these techniques. The heuristics generate smaller unsat cores and diverse satisfying assignments that help in faster convergence of these techniques, and have negligible runtime overhead. We detail these heuristics, incorporate them in CAR, and perform an extensive experimental evaluation of their performance, showing a 25% boost in bug-finding efficiency of CAR. We contribute a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of these heuristics: their influence on SAT-based bug-finding enables detection of different bugs from BMC-based checking. We find the new heuristics are applicable to IC3/PDR-based algorithms as well, and contribute a modified clause generalization procedure.},

abstract  = {We present a new safety hardware model checker SimpleCAR that serves as a reference implementation for evaluating Complementary Approximate Reachability (CAR), a new SAT-based model checking framework inspired by classical reachability analysis. The tool gives a “bottom-line” performance measure for comparing future extensions to the framework. We demonstrate the performance of SimpleCAR on challenging benchmarks from the Hardware Model Checking Competition. Our experiments indicate that SimpleCAR is particularly suited for unsafety checking, or bug-finding; it is able to solve 7 unsafe instances within 1 hour that are not solvable by any other state-of-the-art techniques, including BMC and IC3/PDR, within 8 hours. We also identify a bug (reports safe instead of unsafe) and 48 counterexample generation errors in the tools compared in our analysis.},

abstract  = {Modern system design often requires comparing several models over a large design space. Different models arise out of a need to weigh different design choices, to check core capabilities of versions with varying features, or to analyze a future version against previous ones. Model checking can compare different models; however, applying model checking off-the-shelf may not scale due to the large size of the design space for today’s complex systems. We exploit relationships between different models of the same (or related) systems to optimize the model-checking search. Our algorithm, D3, preprocesses the design space and checks fewer model-checking instances, e.g., using nuXmv. It automatically prunes the search space by reducing both the number of models to check, and the number of LTL properties that need to be checked for each model in order to provide the complete model-checking verdict for every individual model-property pair. We formalize heuristics that improve the performance of D3. We demonstrate the scalability of D3 by extensive experimental evaluation, e.g., by checking 1,620 real-life models for NASA’s NextGen air traffic control system. Compared to checking each model-property pair individually, D3 is up to 9.4× faster.},

abstract  = {The design of safety-critical systems often requires design space exploration: comparing several system models that differ in terms of design choices, capabilities, and implementations. Model checking can compare different models in such a set, however, it is continuously challenged by the state space explosion problem. Therefore, learning and reusing information from solving related models becomes very important for future checking efforts. For example, reusing variable ordering in BDD-based model checking leads to substantial performance improvement. In this paper, we present a SAT-based algorithm for checking a set of models. Our algorithm, FuseIC3, extends IC3 to minimize time spent in exploring the common state space between related models. Specifically, FuseIC3 accumulates artifacts from the sequence of over-approximated reachable states, called frames, from earlier runs when checking new models, albeit, after careful repair. It uses bidirectional reachability; forward reachability to repair frames, and IC3-type backward reachability to block predecessors to bad states. We extensively evaluate FuseIC3 over a large collection of challenging benchmarks. FuseIC3 is on average up to 5.48× (median 1.75×) faster than checking each model individually, and up to 3.67× (median 1.72×) faster than the state-of-the-art incremental IC3 algorithm.},

abstract  = {—Existing wired networks add weight and complexity to current aircraft design. To reduce weight of aircraft, it is essential to decrease the number of wired components and move them to wireless. However, migration of wired to wireless needs to be supported by a thorough analysis of the complexities and failure aspects of the two mediums. The wireless network needs to be at least as reliable and fault tolerant as the existing wired network. This paper proposes a formal framework for a comparative safety analysis of wired and wireless networks. Due to the plug-and-play nature of the framework, it is adaptable to a wide variety of network protocols. It facilitates identification of the minimum set of events that lead to system failure, and using quantified failure probabilities recommends fault tolerant mechanisms that increase system reliability. Designers can then compare candidates for wireless protocols among each other, as well as the wired network, and make informed design decisions},
